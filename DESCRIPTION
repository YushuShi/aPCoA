Description: In fields such as ecology, microbiology, and genomics, non-Euclidean distances are widely applied to describe pairwise dissimilarity between samples. Given these pairwise distances, principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) is commonly used to construct a visualization of the data. However, confounding covariates can make patterns related to the scientific question of interest difficult to observe. We provide 'aPCoA' as an easy-to-use tool to improve data visualization in this context, enabling enhanced presentation of the effects of interest.
